# Multi Tab React Navigation

This is a basic example of multi tab in react navigation.
If we have 2 or more different user type based on product logic. So maybe we need so separate bottom tabs based on user type. Lets say for user type VENDOR, it is should show bottom tabs Chat, Home and Profile but for user type USER, it is should show bottom tabs Product, Cart and Profile. So you can take a look from this repo, how to achieve that.
